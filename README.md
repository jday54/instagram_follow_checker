# instagram_follow_checker
Reports which accounts on Instagram don't follow you back

# Info
The program can either be run via the executable or with Python using the provided python script. Python requirments are Python 3.8.3 and easygui (version 0.98.1).

# How to use the executable (for Mac):
- First, download a copy of your data from Instragram (link: https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920)
- Download the "check_follow_back" executable from this github repository.
- You will have to give your Mac permission to execute the file since it is from an unidentified developer (link: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)
- Then give the file executable permissions by running the following in a terminal:
  > chmod +x check_follow_back
- The executable can then be run either directly from the terminal or by double clicking on the file
- After starting the program, follow the instruction prompts to select the appropriate files (from the Instagram data download).
- When the program has finished, the username of all the accounts that don't follow you back will be saved to an HTML file which you can open in any web browser

# For Windows:
- Has not been tested yet. If executable does not work, I recommend running the Python script.
